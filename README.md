# Cards & Monsters

This app allows you to battle against virtual monsters using decks that you create. With each battle you track your progress, and unlock achievements.

To get started, you'll need to create a deck of cards, each with its unique abilities and attributes. As you battle, you can use these cards to fight against the monsters you encounter.

To battle a monster, you'll need to be in the vicinity of its location, as indicated on the app's map view. Once you're close enough, you can scan for monsters and begin the battle.

As you battle against more monsters, you'll be able to track your progress and achievements through the app's collections feature. This feature allows you to track your progress towards completing different challenges.
